## Welcome!

The Google Developer Group of Hudson Valley is a community-run organization with a simple mission: _grow awareness of emerging technologies & drive actionable learning that leads to professional and personal growth._

Join our [Meetup](https://meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley) to see past events and be notified of new ones. Or join us on [Slack](https://gdghv.herokuapp.com) to engage with the local community.

### Code of Conduct
We pride ourselves on being a safe and welcoming community for **everyone**, with a strict code of conduct. Simply put: ```Be excellent to each other!```. That means no violence of any sort, no physical, digital or mental harassment, no use of inappropriate language or imagery, or any behavior that can cause others to feel unsafe or uncomfortable in these shared environments. We reserve the right to remove violators from our events, and potentially ban them from the community itself if the behavior justifies it.

### Hello, GDG NYC!
We are also a sibling chapter to the [Google Developer Group NYC](https://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc) and often share resources or events that can benefit the broader New York community. If you have an interest in those events, consider joining the [GDG NYC Slack](https://gdgny.herokuapp.com) as well.
